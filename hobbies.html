                    Here are some of the things that I have been up to recently!

                        I started playing guitar in 2014 with my first guitar being an SG. Though I enjoy learning songs, I am currently learning music theory to play more freely and incorporate various scales and chords into my playing. My favorite guitar I have been using recently is my '22 reissue 1959 Epiphone Les Paul.

                     I enjoy building and collecting legos in my spare time! I bought my first lego set of Star Wars ARC-170 in 2005 and I have been hooked ever since. The largest set I have built is the UCS Star Destroyer at 3,106 pieces. As much as I'd like to get as many sets as possible, I try to hunt for specific sets and minifigures that I like best. One of the more recent sets I put together was Ghost & Phantom II from Star Wars Ahsoka.
