                    <p>My Name is Reed Corrin, I am a senior at Michigan State University studying for a bachelor's degree in Media and Information. By working towards this degree, I have learned much about how networks are created in social environments and how the transfer of information works on a digital scale. Working in Media and information has also provided me experience of working with small scaled ICT projects. While I work on my Degree, I have been working at a small IT division for the Engineering College in a group called DECS. Working at DECS has provided me with the opportunity to manage domain computers through Windows SCCM and become familiar with the different devices, servers, and computers that are connected to the Engineering Domain. Using the skills I have aquired at Michigan State, I am looking to work in the IT environment and find a position in network management.</p>
